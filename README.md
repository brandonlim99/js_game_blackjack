# js_game_blackjack

This game was built as a project & milestone to practice what I've learnt in vanilla Javascript. 
This blackjack game features:
- Ace having a value of 1 or 11 (Ace value will be 1 if it will burst with 11, Ace value will be 11 if it won't burst)

Will feature:
- Winning will award you money depending on your win criteria (Normal winning against dealer gives you x1, blackjack will be x2)
- A dealer who will fight with your hand
- Number of times you won
- Able to input your name
